# Solution Approach/ Observation:-
# Letâ€™s look at the inorder traversal of the tree. In the ideal case, the inorder
# traversal should be sorted. But in this case, because of the swapping 2 cases might arise : 1) A sequence like {1,
# 4, 3, 7, 9}, where the swapped pair are adjacent to each other. Only one inversion ( Inversion here means pair of
# integer A[i], A[i+1] where A[i] > A[i+1] ). 2) A sequence like {1, 9, 4, 5, 3, 10} where the swapped pair are not
# adjacent. 2 inversions. We take the min and max of the inversion numbers, and we know the number we need to swap to
# get the right answer.
