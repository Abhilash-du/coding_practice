# Problem Description
# Given a linked list of integers, find and return the middle element of the linked list.
# NOTE: If there are N nodes in the linked list and N is even then return the (N/2 + 1)th element.
#
# Problem Constraints
# 1 <= length of the linked list <= 100000
# 1 <= Node value <= 109
#
# Input Format
# The only argument given head pointer of linked list.
#
# Output Format
# Return the middle element of the linked list.#
#
# Example Input
# Input 1:  1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
# Input 2:  1 -> 5 -> 6 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4
#
# Example Output
# Output 1:  3
# Output 2:  2
#
# Example Explanation
# Explanation 1:  The middle element is 3.
# Explanation 2:  The middle element in even length linked list of length N is ((N/2) + 1)th element which is 2.

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#    def __init__(self, x):
#        self.val = x
#        self.next = None

class Solution:
    # @param A : head node of linked list
    # @return an integer
    def solve(self, A):
        node = A
        fast = A
        slow = fast
        while fast is not None and fast.next is not None:
            fast = fast.next.next
            slow = slow.next
        return slow.val

# Solution Approach/Observation:-
# One way is to traverse the whole linked list and calculate the length and then
# traverse half the length to find the middle element.
#
# We can do it in one traversal by maintaining a slow and fast pointer.
#
# The fast pointer moves twice as the slow pointer does. When the fast pointer is at the end of the linked list,
# the slow pointer will point to the middle element.
#
# Return the element at which the slow pointer points.
