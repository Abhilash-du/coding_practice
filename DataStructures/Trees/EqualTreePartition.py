# Problem Description:-
# Given a binary tree A.
# Check whether it is possible to partition the tree to two trees which have equal sum of values after removing exactly
# one edge on the original tree.
#
# Problem Constraints
# 1 <= size of tree <= 100000
# 0 <= value of node <= 10**9
#
# Input Format
# First and only argument is head of tree A.
#
# Output Format
# Return 1 if the tree can be partitioned into two trees of equal sum else return 0.
#
# Example Input
# Input 1:
#           5
#         /    \
#         3     7
#        / \   / \
#       4   6  5  6
#
# Input2:
#           1
#          /  \
#         2   10
#             / \
#            20  2
#
# Example Output
# Output 1:  1
# Output 2: 0

        self.findSum(A, total_sum // 2)  # checks if the tree can be divided into two equal node sums
        return self.ans
#
# Solution Approach/Observation:-
# After removing some edge from parent to child,
# (where the child cannot be the original root)
# the subtree rooted at child must be half the sum of the entire tree.
#
# Letâ€™s record the sum of every subtree. We can do this recursively using depth-first search.
# After, we should check that half the sum of the entire tree occurs somewhere in our recording
# (and not from the total of the entire tree.)
