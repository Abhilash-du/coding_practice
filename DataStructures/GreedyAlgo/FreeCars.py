# Problem Description:
# Given two arrays, A and B of size N. A[i] represents the time by which you can buy the ith car
# without paying any money.
#
# B[i] represents the profit you can earn by buying the ith car. It takes 1 minute to buy a car, so you can only buy
# the ith car when the current time <= A[i] - 1.
#
# Your task is to find the maximum profit one can earn by buying cars considering that you can only buy one car at a
# time.
#
# NOTE:
# You can start buying from time = 0.
# Return your answer modulo 109 + 7.
#
# Problem Constraints
# 1 <= N <= 105
# 1 <= A[i] <= 109
# 0 <= B[i] <= 109
#
# Input Format
# The first argument is an integer array A represents the deadline for buying the cars.
# The second argument is an integer array B represents the profit obtained after buying the cars.
#
# Output Format
# Return an integer denoting the maximum profit you can earn.
#
# Example Input
# Input 1:
#  A = [1, 3, 2, 3, 3]
#  B = [5, 6, 1, 3, 9]
#
# Input 2:
#  A = [3, 8, 7, 5]
#  B = [3, 1, 7, 19]
#
# Example Output
# Output 1:  20
# Output 2:  30
#
# Example Explanation
# Explanation 1:
#  At time 0, buy car with profit 5.
#  At time 1, buy car with profit 6.
#  At time 2, buy car with profit 9.
#  At time = 3 or after , you can't buy any car, as there is no car with deadline >= 4.
#  So, total profit that one can earn is 20.
#
# Explanation 2:
#  At time 0, buy car with profit 3.
#  At time 1, buy car with profit 1.
#  At time 2, buy car with profit 7.
#  At time 3, buy car with profit 19.
#  We are able to buy all cars within their deadline. So, total profit that one can earn is 30.

# Solution Approach/Observation:-
# If at any time we have the option to buy a car which gives more profit than any of the car already taken.
# At a particular time, We can buy a car or not.
# If we are able to buy all the cars, then itâ€™s fine.
# If not then we should remove a car with minimum profit which we had bought earlier and take the car with more profit.
# Steps Followed:-
# We will have to firstly sort the input based on the deadline
# Now since we have to make sure to have high rewarding cars based on deadline, we can use min heap and
# remove the car with minimum reward (based on deadline)
# Since we have sorted based in deadline in each iteration we can have to check two things:
#  1. if deadline has not passed (ie deadline is greater than all existing tasks): simply append in the min heap
#  2. If deadline has passed or is already there, remove minimum deadline with the maximum one
# Finally we can add all the values of the items from the heap
