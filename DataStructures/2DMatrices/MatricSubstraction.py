# Problem Description
#
# You are given two integer matrices A and B having same size
# (Both having same number of rows (N) and columns (M)).
# You have to subtract matrix A from B and return the resultant matrix.
# (i.e. return the matrix A - B).

# If X and Y are two matrices of the same order (same dimensions).
# Then X - Y is a matrix of the same order as X and Y and
# its elements are obtained by subtracting the elements of Y from
# the corresponding elements of X. Thus if Z = [z[i][j]] = X - Y,
# then [z[i][j]] = [x[i][j]] â€“ [y[i][j]].

# Problem Constraints:-
# 1 <= N, M <= 103
# -109 <= A[i][j], B[i][j] <= 109

# Input Format
# First argument is a 2D integer matrix A.
# Second argument is a 2D integer matrix B.
#
# Output Format
# Return a 2D matrix denoting A - B.
# Example Input
# Input 1:
#  A = [[1, 2, 3],            B = [[9, 8, 7],
#       [4, 5, 6],                 [6, 5, 4],
#       [7, 8, 9]]                 [3, 2, 1]]
# Input 2:
#  A = [[1, 1]]               B = [[2, 3]]

# Example Output
# Output 1:
#  [[-8, -6, -4],
#   [-2, 0, 2],
#   [4, 6, 8]]
# Output 2:
#  [[-1, -2]]

class Solution:
    # @param A : list of list of integers
    # @param B : list of list of integers
    # @return a list of list of integers
    def solve(self, A, B):
        n1 = len(A)
        n2 = len(A[0])
        newA = [[0] * n2 for _ in range(n1)]
        for i in range(n1):
            for j in range(n2):
                newA[i][j] = A[i][j] - B[i][j]
        return newA


# to execute  the code:-
A = [
    [1, 2],
    [4, 5],
    [7, 8]
]

B = [
    [9, 8],
    [6, 5],
    [3, 2]
]
matrix_sub = Solution()
print(matrix_sub.solve(A, B))

# Observation and Approach followed:-
# Below mentioned steps explains how we can find difference of two matrices:
# => To subtract two matrices we have to subtract their corresponding elements.
# For example, newA[i][j] = A[i][j] - B[i][j].
# => Traverse both matrices row wise(first all elements of a row, then jump to next row) using two loops.
# => For every element A[i][j], subtract it with corresponding element B[i][j] and
# store the result in difference matrix at newA[i][j].
